# Who Gets You? Game Development

# Game rules

* At the start, players enter their names. The host creates a room and then other players join the room.  
* There are 2 gameplay modes: Simple and Bluffing  
* There are 2 theme modes: Static and Dynamic. Static means that at the beginning of the game, themes are selected by the host and they will not be changed during the game play. Dynamic means that during game play, each turn, a theme is selected.  
* There are 3 levels: Narrow, Medium and Deep; corresponding to the hard level of question giving answers to be guessed by players. There are also 2 modes to select level: static and dynamic. Static means level is set at the beginning by the host. Dynamic means level is selected during each turn in game play.  
* The game proceeds in turns with random predefined order of players  
* For each turn:  
  * One player is chosen as The Storyteller, the others are The Listeners  
  * The Storyteller will select Theme if Theme mode is dynamic.  
  * The Storyteller will select the level if the level mode is dynamic.  
  * A question is generated by LLM (with a list of already selected questions). The Storyteller can change the question if he/she finds it not appropriate.  
  * The Storyteller answers that question (answer choices might be generated by LLM if the player chooses the “Suggest answer” option, if not, the player enters the answer by himself or herself). However, in the Bluffing gameplay mode, The Storyteller has to enter another answer (trap answer) which is not correct but he/she thinks the other players would choose this one.  
  * After The Storyteller finishes answers, the other players have to guess his/her answer. LLM generates multi choices, of which there is correct answer (and trap answer if in Bluffing gameplay mode), and other players will choose one  
    * Simple gameplay mode: For Narrow level questions: if The Listeners guess correctly the answer, they gain 1 point. If at least one of the Listeners but not all guess correctly the answer, The Storyteller gains 1 point. If all The Listeners guess correctly the answer, The Storyteller gains 2 points. For Medium level questions, points time 2 for each case. For Deep level questions, point time 3 for each case.  
    * Bluffing gameplay mode: For Narrow level questions: if the Listeners guess correctly the answer, they gain 1 point. If at least one of the Listeners but not all guess correctly the answer, the Storyteller gains 1 point. If only a Listener guesses correctly the answer, both that Listener and Storyteller gain 3 points. If all the Listeners guess correctly the answer, the Storyteller doesn’t gain any points but each Listener gains 2 points instead of 1 point. For Medium level questions, points time 2 for each case. For Deep level questions, point time 3 for each case.  
* The game turns to another Storyteller.  
* The game ends when a player reaches a predefined highest score (configurable), or when all the user clicks "End game" and the player with the highest score wins.
